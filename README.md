ðŸ“Š **Netflix Data Analysis Project**

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Netflix data to gain insights into the content available on the platform. Leveraging Python and several data science libraries including Pandas, Plotly Express, and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, I delved into various aspects of Netflix's content catalog.

Here's a glimpse of what I explored:

1. **Content Ratings Distribution:** I began by examining the distribution of content ratings using interactive pie charts, shedding light on the variety of audience preferences on Netflix.

2. **Top Directors and Actors:** I identified the top directors and actors contributing to Netflix's vast library, providing valuable insights into the creative forces behind the platform's content.

3. **Content Production Trends:** Analyzing the trend of content production over the years, I visualized the evolution of Netflix's offerings, providing a historical perspective on the platform's growth.

4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizing sentiment analysis techniques, I gauged the emotional tone of Netflix's content descriptions over time, uncovering patterns in audience engagement and reception.

This project not only showcases my data analysis skills but also offers actionable insights for content creators, marketers, and decision-makers in the entertainment industry.
